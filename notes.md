    1. The HTML is the structure. It's going to contain all the text, the various images tied to the text, and it will generally group things together. Just like the drywall in your house, HTML doesn't do anything other than exist. It relies on other things to do things for it and to it.
    
    2. The CSS is the blueprint. It's all the rules of what goes where, what color it is, what size it is, what font it is, what the decorative background images are, Like HTML, CSS doesn't do anything, it's just a set of rules that describe what things go where and how they look.
    
    3. The frontend / client JavaScript is the smart home. It's all the cool pre-programmed stuff you can tell your house to do. JavaScript is what can change the HTML and CSS to react to various stimuli.
    
    4. The backend code (we'll still use JavaScript) is the pizza place. It's a place where we can request things from and it will send back what we ask for. Or we can send things to it, like when you upload a new photo to your social media account. One server serves many clients, just like one pizza place serves many homes.

## Trusted Resources
Something really important is that you choose to learn from good sources. Just like it's important to get your news from quality sources, it's important to get your technical information from sound sources. Here are some of my personal favorites:

* For anything to do with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, Mozilla's [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is my go-to. I literally have it open all the time.

* [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) has fashioned itself into a premier development website. It has great content not just for CSS but for HTML and JavaScript too. If I want a tutorial, I'll head there. If I want more technical how-to info, I head to MDN.

* For video content, you really can't beat the rest of the content on [Frontend Masters — Learn JavaScript, React, Vue & Angular from Masters of Front-End Development!](https://frontendmasters.com/). I love it.

* If I’m working with a library or a framework, it's a good idea to head directly to their GitHub (we'll talk about GitHub later) page or their official documentation. It's best to head straigh to the source.
